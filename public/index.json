GRPC is great for designing APIs in advance and having a contract that can be shared between teams.\nLife isn\u0026rsquo;t fair, life isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. Nothing will work out as planned, so let\u0026rsquo;s just go ahead and achieve the peak of bad API design. It will happen anyway, so why not embrace it?\nWhat defines a bad API? # Here are some common pitfalls:\nNo single responsibility principle No versioning No documentation or too much of low quality documentation No consistency in naming conventions or naming conventions that make no sense Overcomplicated data structures Incorrect use of error codes Misleading comments I will try to cover all of these points in this post. Hope you are ready\u0026hellip;\nStarting point with a simple generic API # Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we have application that emits events and has tasks that needs to execute. We want to expose a GRPC API for pushing events and managing tasks. Since there could be thousands of events per second, we want to support batch processing for pushing events. We also want to be able to tell the client which events were successfully processed and which failed.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry, it will get much smaller once we remove all the (un)necessary stuff.\nEvent API # Simple API for pushing events in batch. I even added HTTP annotations for REST compatibility.\nsyntax = \u0026#34;proto3\u0026#34;; package example.v1; go_package = \u0026#34;examplepb/v1\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\u0026#34;; service ApplicationEventService { // Batch push events to the backend for further processing. // Each event will be processed independently, and the response will indicate // which events were successfully processed and which failed. // Any request containg more than the allowed maximum (see GetMaxBatchSize) will be rejected with INVALID_ARGUMENT. rpc PushEvents (PushEventsRequest) returns (PushEventsResponse) { option (google.api.http) = { post: \u0026#34;/v1/events:push\u0026#34; body: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; } // Retrieving how many events can be pushed in a single request. // This allows clients to adjust their batch sizes accordingly. // We want to keep this flexible so that we can change it in the future without breaking clients. rpc GetMaxBatchSize (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (MaxBatchSizeResponse) { option (google.api.http) = { get: \u0026#34;/v1/events:maxBatchSize\u0026#34; }; } } message PushEventsRequest { // Events to be pushed in batch.

Any client can have multiple workers fetching tasks concurrently. This API doesn\u0026rsquo;t address how a worker knows polling rate or notification mechanism.\nsyntax = \u0026#34;proto3\u0026#34;; package example.v1; go_package = \u0026#34;examplepb/v1\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\u0026#34;; service TaskService { // Assign a task to a worker based on its capabilities. // The server will match the worker\u0026#39;s capabilities with task requirements. rpc AssignTask (AssignTaskRequest) returns (AssignTaskResponse) { option (google.api.http) = { post: \u0026#34;/v1/tasks:assign\u0026#34; body: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; } // Acknowledge that a task has been received and is being processed. // This prevents the task from being reassigned to another worker. rpc AcknowledgeTask (AcknowledgeTaskRequest) returns (AcknowledgeTaskResponse) { option (google.api.http) = { post: \u0026#34;/v1/tasks/{task_id}:acknowledge\u0026#34; body: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; } // Complete a task and report the result. // The result can indicate success or failure, along with any relevant details. rpc CompleteTask (CompleteTaskRequest) returns (CompleteTaskResponse) { option (google.api.http) = { post: \u0026#34;/v1/tasks/{task_id}:complete\u0026#34; body: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; } // Reject a task if the worker cannot process it.
