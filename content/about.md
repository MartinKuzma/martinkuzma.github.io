Howdy, traveler! Welcome to my microcosmos. 

## About me
This is my personal blog I use to unleash my creativity whenever I have some spare time. During the day, I'm a software engineer, manager, and father. By night, I am usually sleeping. However, in some precious moments, I like to tinker with new technologies and challenge myself.

## Blog content
What to expect here? I write about pretty much anything technical that fascinates me. Check out the [posts](https://martinkuzma.github.io/posts) for more details. 

## AI use
I wrote all articles myself. I only use AI to help me with grammar, spelling, and featured images.
