Howdy, traveler! Welcome to my microcosmos.

This is my personal blog I use to unleash my creativity whenever I have some spare time. During the day, I'm a software engineer and manager. By night, I am usually sleeping. However, in some precious moments, I like to tinker with new technologies and challenge myself.

Feel free to explore my articles and projects. If you wish to get in touch, you can find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/MrCosmosMartin) or [GitHub](https://github.com/MartinKuzma).
